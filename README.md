## Before deploying an interactive on PageBuilder

* Add an id to whatever sticky figures exist, then give them the CSS rules `position: sticky;` and `position: -webkit-sticky;` in `render.jsp`.

* If a `transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0)` is needed for the sticky element, don't forget to add an equivalent `WebkitTransform` property.
